    "Open LLMs like Meta [Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70b), Mistral AI [Mistral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) & [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) models or AI21 [Jamba](https://huggingface.co/ai21labs/Jamba-v0.1) are now OpenAI competitors. However, most of the time you need to fine-tune the model on your data to unlock the full potential of the model. Fine-tuning smaller LLMs, like Mistral became very accessible on a single GPU by using Q-Lora. But efficiently fine-tuning bigger models like Llama 3 70b or Mixtral stayed a challenge until now. \n",

In addition to FSDP we will use [Flash Attention v2 through the Pytorch SDPA](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-2/) implementation. \n",
